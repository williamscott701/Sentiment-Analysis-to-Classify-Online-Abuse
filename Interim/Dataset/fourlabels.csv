NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::I am beginning to see the problem you have. You see, you do not know how to read what other people say without attaching your personal bias to it. Never once did I say that ultra-Orthodox Jews have no rabbis or synagogues. I DID say that the role of the rabbi and synagogue in ultra-Orthodox Judaism is minimal when compared with, say, Conservative Judaism. They are not clergy, in the traditional Western sense of the word. That is a fact. As for synagogues, they exist, but they are not essential. Minyan (a quorum of ten adult males in ultra-Orthodox law) is essential. You can have a minyan without a synagogue, but a synagogue without a minyan is an empty building.

If you were to draw such sharp distinctions between ultra-Orthodox and Modern Orthodox Judaism in a recognized Judaic Studies program, they would not know what you are talking about. A) That statement is false, because responsa in Orthodoxy does not work on the basis of someone's synagogue affiliation. B) What is a Modern Orthodox responsa versus an ultra-Orthodox responsa? C) In cases where things like hashgacha (kosher certification, etc.) are debated, you will find in most cases that it is not a question of responsa. If you know something about responsa literature in general (which apparently you do not), there are degrees of acceptance. For example, halav yisrael (milk under rabbinical supervision during milking to ensure that it comes from a cow). Most modern-Orthodox Jews do not insist on it t on the basis of a responsa by Rabbi Moshe Feinstein who determined that American government supervision is sufficient. Most ultra-Orthodox Jews do insist on it. They do not reject the responsa. In fact, Moshe Feinstein (Reb Moshe, as he was called) was considered the leading halachic authority for the American ultra-Orthodox community in the past fifty years. They will say that the ruling is right BUT they want to be machmir (more strict on themselves, meaning more pious). It is not a rejection. It is simply being stricter.

And militant Islamism (the militant Islamism of bin Laden, the Saudis, Saddam Hussein, the Baathists, and the Palestinian suicide bombers) or Islamofascism is the enemy of freedom and the distilled essence of evil. Totalitarian ideologies and fanaticisms have come in gone and have been defeated by America. All these ideologies are one in the same. They hate modernity, hate America, hate freedom, hate capitalism, hate liberal democracy, and love terrorism, oppression, genoicide, and fanatic hatred. In Germany the tyranical enemies of freedom and capitalism rallied behind Nazism, in Italy they rallied behind fascism, in Russia they rallied behind totalitarian socialism and communism, and now in the Middle East, where a lot of dictators and tyrants are threatened by freedom and American values, they rally behind militant Islamics. It is fact that there isnt a single Arab democracy. Muslim leaders (Saddam was just the worst of the lot. There will be more dictators/terrorists to fight like the Syrians) are all tyrants and terrorists who stifle the free press, kill their own people, crush their citizens hopes and dreams, and want to kill Americans like they did on 9/11. Their desire to kill Americans and supprot terror rests on one deep, abiding hatred: their irrational fear of America, which sticks up for freedom and opposes their tyranny with great scarafices, like America is doing right now defeating evil in the Arab countries of Iraq and Afghnaistan. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe ideology of militant Islamist terrorism is the totalitarian enemy that America confronts today. And patriotic Americans say it will be defeated like America defeated totalitarianisms in the past through heroic struggle: Communism, fascism, Nazism. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENA lot of conservative commentators who speak with moral clarity call America's struggle against the evil of Islamofascist totalitarianism right now World War IV. That this is freedom's fourth struggle against a totalitarian evil. In WWI it was the despotic rule of the Kaiser, in WWII it was the Nazis, in freedom's third struggle it was the communists in the Cold War (although it wasnt a ``hot war`` it was another global stuggle like a world war). Now America's forth stuggle is a worldwide campaign against states like Iraq that hate the free world, kill their own people, desire weapons of mass destruction, and support terrorism. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe antiwar liberal left appeases totalitarian evil, which they love to do. They rallied to defend the Communists in Vietnam. Now the amoral liberal left is opposing America's commander in chief George W Bush in his struggle in Iraq. Hundreds of millions were slaughtered (Communism murdered 100 million people while the liberals opposed the Cold War at every step) and Communism threatened the freedom of America and her allies. Conservatives say that America must stop this new totalitarian enemy before its murderous hate claims as many victims as Communism. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN`"

personal,"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow that the edit war seems to have died down. I just want to add a little about privatization and free market. Even while the neoliberals ofcourse want to put an equal sign between free market and privatization, very few privatizations are ever made that actually increases the competition in the market. Because if the buisness that is sold to private owners has a monopoly before it is sold, it ofcourse will to after it has been privatized. And if the company is sold while it is already subjected to competition it will to after it has been privatized. Indeed, privatization has nothing to do with ``free markets``, but is only a transferment of public property to private hands. Ofcourse that argument will not keep the neoliberals from claiming the Second Return of Messiah as long as we privatize and the Doomsday if we dont. But atleast we do not have to use their rhethorics. `"

If you can find a source that calls the Spartacists reactionary, or discusses the Freikorps as left liberals, I'd love to see it. You'll note that I didn't reinsert the description of the Nazis themselves as right wing. But I think that saying there are similarities between Nazism and Stalinism, say, is not to deny that Nazism is in some vague sense a movement ``of the right`` and Stalinism a movement ``of the left.`` At any rate, ``what was seen at the time as`` is an incredibly awkward phrasing - it's simply bad writing. As to other changes, things like saying ``this is how the Nazis were different from other Socialists`` is completely POV, in that it says that the Nazis were socialists. And you can't just cite laws as supporting a point without explaining them at all. And it would be nice if you could actually cite scholars who discuss similarities between Nazism and socialism, rather than vague ``supporters`` of such arguments (at the very least, those opposed to such comparisons can cite ``the organized socialist movement`` rather easily, although I would agree that there are somewhat similar problems on that side of the debate.)

I want you to know that despite our disagreements, I really appreciate what you're trying to do. It's difficult for most people to write a truly NPOV article, which is why what Wikipedia does is so great. By having hundreds of thousands of authors, almost every point of view is represented, and people are forced to compromise, usually resulting in pure truth. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENUnfortunately, the Holocaust is one of the few subjects where this doesn't work. It is a subject which should be purely history. The Nazis kept spectacular notes on everything that they did, and it should be spectacularly easy to say ``this here is exactly what happened. We know, because of the monthly reports written by Himmler.`` Unfortunately, Holocaust deniers continually show up, most of whom have no interest in truth or even compromise. They tend to wipe entire paragraphs, and replace them with their own propaganda. This is just who they are. They cannot provide evidence as convincing a page from Hitler's desk ordering the final solution to ``The Jewish Problem`` so they don't listen or compromise and eventually leave in a bad mood.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAt the same time, I can't exactly claim to be NPOV either. It is fairly clear from what I have already written here that I hold Holocaust deniers in no high esteem. Quite frankly, I find their so called ``beliefs`` to be an attack against me and my people. It is, to me, like someone claiming there was never racial segregation in the United States, and that even if there was, the slave owners didn't know their slaves were being beaten. It would be an absolutely ridiculous claim, and yet people get away with it in reference to the Jews. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt is good, therefore, that someone has shown up who is interested in this issue, but who has no real stake in the argument. I would caution you, however, against being overly zealous in your changes. Holocaust deniers are, by and large, anti-Semitic. My personal favourite group believes that Jews are shape shifting lizards from Mars who are infiltrating the world governments in order to enslave humanity. And yes, this group has a following. The ``Holocaust Revisionist`` lines and the ``Jewish persecution was wrong`` lines are simply ways of attracting new followers who can then be trained to believe just about anything once they've got their foot in the door. The people running these groups are solely occupied with promoting anti-Semitism in the hopes that some day they can finish off what Hitler started. I encourage you to write carefully about what they believe, but please don't be fooled by them.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI wish you the best of luck. `"

But that's not the point here. It's a fact that these floppies have been called 5Â¼- and 3Â½-inch and that has to be seen in a historical perspective. The fact that the 3Â½-disk is actually 90Â mm in size has also been clearly stated in the article. (It might have been called a ``90 disk`` or something similar, if it was invented 10 years from now ) And even when using the metric system, you'll sometimes run into ``misnomers``; if you bought a 2Â½-litre car it is highly likely that it sports an engine with only 2,4895 litres of displacement. 07:36, 2004 May 21 (UTC)NEWLINE_TOKEN`"

I've been trying to think back to when bosses became popular (a mite difficult seeing as I would have been about five years old), and it seems that the flash point is in 1985.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:However, I am quite heavily biased toward scrolling shooters, so I'm probably missing something important. Bosses are, on the other hand, probably more important in scrolling shooters than any other genre, because they have to break up the linearity of the game.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Anyway. In 1985, you've that Mario game thingy, and Gradius, which is the first time I can recall having to fight a huge boss character. Then in 1986 you've got Darius, which is the earliest game I know of that had different bosses for every level. I think it had minibosses too.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:And then it really gets going. In 1987, I can name R-Type, Raiden, and Rainbow Islands as having distinct bosses, and by this point it was all pretty standard. But I'm just namedropping (and article-dropping too, seeing as I wrote most of those articles ;) ). The point is that there seems to be a dark age of bosses before 1985, so it would probably be interesting to unravel that.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:The very earliest enemy-that-could-conceivably-be-thought-of-as-a-boss that I can think of (not including that Dungeons and Dragons thing mentioned in the article, which I know nothing about) is the Flag Ship from Gorf, an arcade game released in 1981, in the prime of the Space Invaders Era. Gorf was like five games in one, and when the player completed a level, they would move onto a level in the next game.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:The fifth level was a battle with the Flag Ship. It has all the hallmarks of a boss: It's much bigger than the player's ship, much better armed, has its own forcefield, and is only minorly damaged by the player's weapon. The only way to destroy it is to hit it in its weak spot - a reactor situated deep within the ship.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Now I think about it, I don't know why I didn't mention this before. The thing is, I always thought of the Flag Ship as a 'level' rather than a boss. There wasn't really any concept of a boss at that point in history. Still, it's a start."

What about non-vocal languages (finger snaps - all that stuff). Sign-language? We now have some evidence that hand gestures are linked to language in the brain...but I digress. From a simplistic point of view language can be thought of as being three distinct (context sensitive) types of communication: written/read, spoken/heard and performed/viewed. I suppose an alphabet can't cover the last (but see how choreographers describe dance) and, obviously, there are non-alphabetical languages (pictographics, heiroglyphic, etc.) just as there are languages which make use of whistles, clicks. SO what does the IPA do?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt just occured to me that maybe the IPA is (now-a-days) only used by euro-centric hobbyists and that would explain why there was no attention given to giving a serious explanation of what it is: ``if you have to ask...{then you don't need to know}```"

The article should describe that. But the relationship is there - plenty of people accuse Rand of being an anarcho-capitalist, regardless of her denials of that fact, for instance. And plenty of people accuse the Libertarians of that. I mean, I think the umbrella label ``anarchism`` is a problematic one in a lot of ways - particularly in how so many groups simultaneously want to claim the label and avoid the label.

personal,"NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhile you are correct that 'toughened glass' could be considered a misnomer (toughness has a specific meaning with regard to the strength of materials), tempering glass is not. In fact there are two ways to temper glass to increase its strength: thermal and chemical. Regarding thermal tempering, you are incorrect that the surface of a glass is in tension even at room temperature. On initial cooling you are correct that the surface is in tension and the interior is in compression. However, below the glass transition temperature the stresses reverse and the surface is in compression and the interior is in tension increasing the strength of the glass. Prince Rupert's drops are a laboratory curiousity demonstrating this phenomena. If a drop of molten glass is cast into a container of water, it solidifies into a shape roughly resembling a tadpole. You can bang on the big end with a hammer and the glass drop will not break. However if you nip the tail, the drop disintegrates into dust usually with a pop. Thermal tempering is usually applied to windshields. Chemical tempering is usually accomplished by ion exchanging a smaller atom for a larger atom at the surface again putting the surface in compression. Although glazing and surface crystallization can also be used. For example, soda-lime-silica glass can be placed into molten potassium nitrate and exchange potassium for sodium in the surface increasing the strength of the glass. Thermal tempering can increase the strength of glass from 70 to 200 MPa while chemical tempering can increase it 500 to 700 MPa. Chemical tempering is commonly used to increase the strength of beverage containers."

Right Totalitarian regimes see hierarchy as the natural and permanent order of things, and the existence of private property is not a mean to an end, but the end to be preserved within itself. A broad definition of fascism which would more correctly have to be termed corporatism if we say that mysticism, gender roles, and ideological heritage/stated aims aren't necessary conditions, then that would also allow us to place countries like the U.S since the 1930's, social-democratic Germany, and Keynesian Japan in that category.NEWLINE_TOKENThe main difference between fascism and capitalist-democratic or more benign corporatist states is the right for trade unions and combinations to engage in collective bargaining and even work stopages (strikes) against the immediate consent of the state or business. NEWLINE_TOKENUnions have this right in China today, to a limited extent, as in the U.S to a limited extent. On an economic basis, Germany may be considered more corporatist or economically interventionist than the U.S, but politically the citizens have more rights to protest and engage in collective bargaining or form new unions.NEWLINE_TOKENUnless I can be swayed from this line of thought, and I am open to it, I will mercilessly edit out grouping the PRC as fascist.

The article seems to lean too much towards being about the movie, which makes it seem as if it was the original source material instead of the book.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::I am beginning to see the problem you have. You see, you do not know how to read what other people say without attaching your personal bias to it. Never once did I say that ultra-Orthodox Jews have no rabbis or synagogues. I DID say that the role of the rabbi and synagogue in ultra-Orthodox Judaism is minimal when compared with, say, Conservative Judaism. They are not clergy, in the traditional Western sense of the word. That is a fact. As for synagogues, they exist, but they are not essential. Minyan (a quorum of ten adult males in ultra-Orthodox law) is essential. You can have a minyan without a synagogue, but a synagogue without a minyan is an empty building.

If you were to draw such sharp distinctions between ultra-Orthodox and Modern Orthodox Judaism in a recognized Judaic Studies program, they would not know what you are talking about.

C) In cases where things like hashgacha (kosher certification, etc.) are debated, you will find in most cases that it is not a question of responsa. If you know something about responsa literature in general (which apparently you do not), there are degrees of acceptance. For example, halav yisrael (milk under rabbinical supervision during milking to ensure that it comes from a cow). Most modern-Orthodox Jews do not insist on it t on the basis of a responsa by Rabbi Moshe Feinstein who determined that American government supervision is sufficient. Most ultra-Orthodox Jews do insist on it. They do not reject the responsa. In fact, Moshe Feinstein (Reb Moshe, as he was called) was considered the leading halachic authority for the American ultra-Orthodox community in the past fifty years. They will say that the ruling is right BUT they want to be machmir (more strict on themselves, meaning more pious). It is not a rejection. It is simply being stricter.

And militant Islamism (the militant Islamism of bin Laden, the Saudis, Saddam Hussein, the Baathists, and the Palestinian suicide bombers) or Islamofascism is the enemy of freedom and the distilled essence of evil. Totalitarian ideologies and fanaticisms have come in gone and have been defeated by America. All these ideologies are one in the same. They hate modernity, hate America, hate freedom, hate capitalism, hate liberal democracy, and love terrorism, oppression, genoicide, and fanatic hatred. In Germany the tyranical enemies of freedom and capitalism rallied behind Nazism, in Italy they rallied behind fascism, in Russia they rallied behind totalitarian socialism and communism, and now in the Middle East, where a lot of dictators and tyrants are threatened by freedom and American values, they rally behind militant Islamics. It is fact that there isnt a single Arab democracy. Muslim leaders (Saddam was just the worst of the lot. There will be more dictators/terrorists to fight like the Syrians) are all tyrants and terrorists who stifle the free press, kill their own people, crush their citizens hopes and dreams, and want to kill Americans like they did on 9/11. Their desire to kill Americans and supprot terror rests on one deep, abiding hatred: their irrational fear of America, which sticks up for freedom and opposes their tyranny with great scarafices, like America is doing right now defeating evil in the Arab countries of Iraq and Afghnaistan. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe ideology of militant Islamist terrorism is the totalitarian enemy that America confronts today. And patriotic Americans say it will be defeated like America defeated totalitarianisms in the past through heroic struggle: Communism, fascism, Nazism. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENA lot of conservative commentators who speak with moral clarity call America's struggle against the evil of Islamofascist totalitarianism right now World War IV. That this is freedom's fourth struggle against a totalitarian evil. In WWI it was the despotic rule of the Kaiser, in WWII it was the Nazis, in freedom's third struggle it was the communists in the Cold War (although it wasnt a ``hot war`` it was another global stuggle like a world war). Now America's forth stuggle is a worldwide campaign against states like Iraq that hate the free world, kill their own people, desire weapons of mass destruction, and support terrorism. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe antiwar liberal left appeases totalitarian evil, which they love to do. They rallied to defend the Communists in Vietnam. Now the amoral liberal left is opposing America's commander in chief George W Bush in his struggle in Iraq. Hundreds of millions were slaughtered (Communism murdered 100 million people while the liberals opposed the Cold War at every step) and Communism threatened the freedom of America and her allies. Conservatives say that America must stop this new totalitarian enemy before its murderous hate claims as many victims as Communism. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN`"

Even while the neoliberals ofcourse want to put an equal sign between free market and privatization, very few privatizations are ever made that actually increases the competition in the market. Because if the buisness that is sold to private owners has a monopoly before it is sold, it ofcourse will to after it has been privatized. And if the company is sold while it is already subjected to competition it will to after it has been privatized. Indeed, privatization has nothing to do with ``free markets``, but is only a transferment of public property to private hands. Ofcourse that argument will not keep the neoliberals from claiming the Second Return of Messiah as long as we privatize and the Doomsday if we dont. But atleast we do not have to use their rhethorics. `"

If you can find a source that calls the Spartacists reactionary, or discusses the Freikorps as left liberals, I'd love to see it. You'll note that I didn't reinsert the description of the Nazis themselves as right wing.

As to other changes, things like saying ``this is how the Nazis were different from other Socialists`` is completely POV, in that it says that the Nazis were socialists. And you can't just cite laws as supporting a point without explaining them at all. And it would be nice if you could actually cite scholars who discuss similarities between Nazism and socialism, rather than vague ``supporters`` of such arguments (at the very least, those opposed to such comparisons can cite ``the organized socialist movement`` rather easily, although I would agree that there are somewhat similar problems on that side of the debate.)

I want you to know that despite our disagreements, I really appreciate what you're trying to do. It's difficult for most people to write a truly NPOV article, which is why what Wikipedia does is so great. By having hundreds of thousands of authors, almost every point of view is represented, and people are forced to compromise, usually resulting in pure truth. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENUnfortunately, the Holocaust is one of the few subjects where this doesn't work. It is a subject which should be purely history. The Nazis kept spectacular notes on everything that they did, and it should be spectacularly easy to say ``this here is exactly what happened. We know, because of the monthly reports written by Himmler.`` Unfortunately, Holocaust deniers continually show up, most of whom have no interest in truth or even compromise. They tend to wipe entire paragraphs, and replace them with their own propaganda. This is just who they are. They cannot provide evidence as convincing a page from Hitler's desk ordering the final solution to ``The Jewish Problem`` so they don't listen or compromise and eventually leave in a bad mood.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAt the same time, I can't exactly claim to be NPOV either. It is fairly clear from what I have already written here that I hold Holocaust deniers in no high esteem. Quite frankly, I find their so called ``beliefs`` to be an attack against me and my people. It is, to me, like someone claiming there was never racial segregation in the United States, and that even if there was, the slave owners didn't know their slaves were being beaten. It would be an absolutely ridiculous claim, and yet people get away with it in reference to the Jews. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt is good, therefore, that someone has shown up who is interested in this issue, but who has no real stake in the argument. I would caution you, however, against being overly zealous in your changes. Holocaust deniers are, by and large, anti-Semitic. My personal favourite group believes that Jews are shape shifting lizards from Mars who are infiltrating the world governments in order to enslave humanity. And yes, this group has a following. The ``Holocaust Revisionist`` lines and the ``Jewish persecution was wrong`` lines are simply ways of attracting new followers who can then be trained to believe just about anything once they've got their foot in the door. The people running these groups are solely occupied with promoting anti-Semitism in the hopes that some day they can finish off what Hitler started.

I've been trying to think back to when bosses became popular (a mite difficult seeing as I would have been about five years old), and it seems that the flash point is in 1985.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:However, I am quite heavily biased toward scrolling shooters, so I'm probably missing something important. Bosses are, on the other hand, probably more important in scrolling shooters than any other genre, because they have to break up the linearity of the game.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Anyway. In 1985, you've that Mario game thingy, and Gradius, which is the first time I can recall having to fight a huge boss character. Then in 1986 you've got Darius, which is the earliest game I know of that had different bosses for every level. I think it had minibosses too.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:And then it really gets going. In 1987, I can name R-Type, Raiden, and Rainbow Islands as having distinct bosses, and by this point it was all pretty standard. But I'm just namedropping (and article-dropping too, seeing as I wrote most of those articles ;) ). The point is that there seems to be a dark age of bosses before 1985, so it would probably be interesting to unravel that.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:The very earliest enemy-that-could-conceivably-be-thought-of-as-a-boss that I can think of (not including that Dungeons and Dragons thing mentioned in the article, which I know nothing about) is the Flag Ship from Gorf, an arcade game released in 1981, in the prime of the Space Invaders Era. Gorf was like five games in one, and when the player completed a level, they would move onto a level in the next game.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:The fifth level was a battle with the Flag Ship. It has all the hallmarks of a boss: It's much bigger than the player's ship, much better armed, has its own forcefield, and is only minorly damaged by the player's weapon. The only way to destroy it is to hit it in its weak spot - a reactor situated deep within the ship.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Now I think about it, I don't know why I didn't mention this before. The thing is, I always thought of the Flag Ship as a 'level' rather than a boss. There wasn't really any concept of a boss at that point in history. Still, it's a start."

What about non-vocal languages (finger snaps - all that stuff). Sign-language? We now have some evidence that hand gestures are linked to language in the brain...but I digress. From a simplistic point of view language can be thought of as being three distinct (context sensitive) types of communication: written/read, spoken/heard and performed/viewed. I suppose an alphabet can't cover the last (but see how choreographers describe dance) and, obviously, there are non-alphabetical languages (pictographics, heiroglyphic, etc.) just as there are languages which make use of whistles, clicks. SO what does the IPA do?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt just occured to me that maybe the IPA is (now-a-days) only used by euro-centric hobbyists and that would explain why there was no attention given to giving a serious explanation of what it is: ``if you have to ask...{then you don't need to know}```"

In fact there are two ways to temper glass to increase its strength: thermal and chemical. Regarding thermal tempering, you are incorrect that the surface of a glass is in tension even at room temperature. On initial cooling you are correct that the surface is in tension and the interior is in compression. However, below the glass transition temperature the stresses reverse and the surface is in compression and the interior is in tension increasing the strength of the glass. Prince Rupert's drops are a laboratory curiousity demonstrating this phenomena. If a drop of molten glass is cast into a container of water, it solidifies into a shape roughly resembling a tadpole. You can bang on the big end with a hammer and the glass drop will not break. However if you nip the tail, the drop disintegrates into dust usually with a pop. Thermal tempering is usually applied to windshields. Chemical tempering is usually accomplished by ion exchanging a smaller atom for a larger atom at the surface again putting the surface in compression. Although glazing and surface crystallization can also be used. For example, soda-lime-silica glass can be placed into molten potassium nitrate and exchange potassium for sodium in the surface increasing the strength of the glass. Thermal tempering can increase the strength of glass from 70 to 200 MPa while chemical tempering can increase it 500 to 700 MPa. Chemical tempering is commonly used to increase the strength of beverage containers."

And given that the book is the original story, I believe that ``Joe`` should be used more often in the article than ``Jack`` (though ``the narrator`` fits the character's ``name`` more accurately). The article seems to lean too much towards being about the movie, which makes it seem as if it was the original source material instead of the book.

aggression,"NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:I may have left in '86 but my parents still live in the same house. Since you're in the area why don't you go and check - I haven't been up there for about 18 months so things may have been cleaned up, but it didn't look too hopeful since it has been in that state for at least the last ten years. I'd check myself but I actually reside in Australia, so a quick trip is not really feasible right now. If I'm wrong I'll be more than happy to retract my statement, but since the problems appear to be somewhat entrenched, I'm not too hopeful. The area I'm thinking of in particular is the section of Livingstone Walk between Henry Wells Square and the main residential section - there was a major park there that is now closed and unquestionably surrounded by barbed wire. Further on is The Dell which when I visited last was strewn with houshold rubbish and used syringes. I don't think the evidence of my own eyes counts as 'POV'. As for the implication that I might simply be lying about this - why would I want to do that? These places are not the only examples - a tour of the area on foot will confirm what I'm suggesting. As for the CCTV info, it may be true, but it isn't actually very interesting, nor is it worded in a way which makes much sense. Read the sentence again - it does not tell you anything unless you already know what it's meant to be saying. If it can be reworded to say something interesting it might be worth keeping.

aggression,"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Let me explain the problems in your paragraph, which for ease of reference I include below.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Prime Minister Blair is known in Britain as well as the United States for his personal closeness to US President Bush. The two's coordination is uncanny, rarely ever voicing direct disagreements and presenting united stances on most issues; sometimes with Blair going against the Labour party as well as the majority of British citizens. In May, he backed the controversial Israeli withdrawal plan for the Gaza Strip, a radical departure from traditional British politics toward the region, and a move that put the British government in the position of being the only major nation besides the US to support it. He acquiesced to American requests in October to send Scotland's prestigious Black Watch battalion to Baghdad. Recently, the Prime Minister responded to a question on the environment with a stance very close to what the President Bush's was. This ``special relationship`` between George W. Bush and Tony Blair has drawn a mixed bag of reactions in the UK, but it continues to be strong. In November 2004, the Prime Minister travelled to Washington in hopes of using the close friendship to influence the President's stances on a European summit, environment/climate control, and an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:The first sentence is acceptable and is in the article. The second is where the problems start. ``The two's coordination is uncanny`` is the sort of statement one would make about two lovers, and will carry this meaning to readers. As for ``rarely ever voicing direct disagreements``, you will find this in most public utterances in diplomacy, regardless of any actual disagreements. For example read the press conference with Blair and Chirac earlier this month. The issue of dissent within the Labour Party over Blair has already been covered in the article and needs no repeating here.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:The UK government's support for the Gaza withdrawal plan is hardly ``a radical departure`` and, even if it was such a statement would be POV. See 'The Chariot of Israel' by Harold Wilson for the full story of British support for Israel over the years to 1981. Also, the Israeli Labour Party has supported it, and that carries weight in its British sister party. Then the use of the term 'acquiesced' which is only used in a subservient relationship and is therefore pejorative, as is the insertion of 'prestigious' before the regiment: this reads as if it magnifies any offence because the regiment involved was more distinguished than others. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:The remark about the environment lacks any detail but is irrelevant: the UK government policy hasn't changed and is quite distinct from the US, so anything which Blair might have said at a press conference is neither here nor there. Finally we come to a report of Blair's visit to the US which states that it was about the environment (it wasn't - see press conference) and is imprecise. This issue, and the rest of this edit, is better covered in the article as it was, and I have therefore reverted it. `"

Shortly before the event, the board of directors vetoed our admission as exhibitors. Word of our attendance had spread to a minority of Jewish women in the organization who objected to our very presence.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTAB_TOKENNOCIRC has exhibited successfully at literally hundreds of conferences locally, regionally, and nationally. We are asked back year after year. Without religious prejudice, we provide information about the traumatic effects of circumcision. We hand out our information pamphlets in a non-confrontational manner to those who approach our table because they are interested in learning about the issue. Each year, we have a well-received exhibit booth for physicians attending the American Academy of Pediatrics national conference.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTAB_TOKENNOCIRC already counts among its supporters hundreds of LLL members and former members. The silent majority of leaders within League are already on our side. Attendees who were interested would have appreciated our information; those who were not interested would have just walked on by.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTAB_TOKENThe vast majority of boys who are circumcised in the United States are not sons of Jewish or Muslim parents. Preventing these non-religious circumcisions has always been the primary focus for NOCIRC. This painful surgery, the most common procedure that baby boys are forced to experience, puts breastfeeding success at risk. Good chest-to-chest positioning requires mom to press her sonâ€™s wounded penis up against her body, and the pain makes him unable or unwilling to nurse.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTAB_TOKENLa Leche League reported problems with breastfeeding by circumcised infants in their 1981 edition of The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding. In 1996, LLL ratified the Mother-Friendly Childbirth Initiative, along with 25 other organizations. The organization accepted ten basic principles for mother-friendly care, including the requirement that service providers must â€œdiscourage non-religious circumcision of the newborn.â€ (on-line at ).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTAB_TOKENThe breastfeeding relationship does not begin in a vacuum. In 2002, NOCIRC issued its position statement, â€œThe Effects of Circumcision on Breastfeeding,â€ available at . Researchers have found that some male babies are unable to suckle the motherâ€™s breast after circumcision. The circumcised infant is in pain and is in an exhausted, weakened, and debilitated condition. The circumcision procedure frequently causes the newborn to withdraw from his environment, interfering with his process of bonding and breastfeeding.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTAB_TOKENLa Leche League claims it is a non-sectarian organization. However, when it comes to circumcision, it is a religious organization. A few powerful members are keeping clinical data regarding breastfeeding obstacles out of the hands of all members in order to further their personal religious viewpoint. For six years now they have systematically excluded NOCIRC from simply having a table at their area and national conferences.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTAB_TOKENThe Board of Directors has placed a higher priority on protecting religious circumcision than on breastfeeding success for the 94% of non-Jewish, non-Muslim moms. Jewish boys have seven days to establish breastfeeding before undergoing surgery; non-Jewish boys do not because they are circumcised at birth, and thus they are at a greater risk.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTAB_TOKENThe Boardâ€™s action is hypocritical in light of LLLâ€™s own struggle with those who block the promotion of breastfeeding benefits for fear of upsetting parents. LLL has itself been accused of producing guilt when they describe the advantages of breastfeeding in much the same way that NOCIRC is now being accused by LLL.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTAB_TOKENLLL has an obligation to its members to make available information on how circumcision affects breastfeeding. New and expectant moms need this information ASAP in order to nurture a successful breastfeeding relationship with their sons. NOCIRC can help to insure that this happens.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENT"

It is a recognized problem as the data in the article reflects. We don't balance articles about Nazi concentration camps by renaming it ``Violence in the Nazi-Jewish conflict`` and then inserting sections about Jewish uprisings against the Nazis in order to deflect attention from Nazi atrocities and paint the deaths of oppressed Jews and oppressing Nazis as if they are equivalent. That is what the WikiZionists intend to do. They want to rename this article to something ``neutral`` (i.e. something that doesn't reflect the facts about Israeli atrocities against Palestinian children) and then pad it with sensationalized Zionist POV sections about Palestinian resistance to Zionist aggression. They already have plenty of Zionist POV articles smearing all palestinians as fanatic terrorists rather than victims of Zionist terrorism. This is one article devoted to documenting the facts about Israeli violence against Palestinian children. `

aggression,"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENÂ§ I got in touch with the owner of the website mentioned above, and he has offered to e-mail me a scanned copy of the map in the book illustration, which shows an intermediate band where the white band occurs near the northern tip of Africa. I had a closer look at the maps I found in the library, and none of them improves on what was in that website. The one major difference that a revised map probably ought to take account of is the division of Australia into two regions. I'll make overlays to check, but it looks like the only other changes involve reducing 8 zones to 5. If you check out the Cavelli-Sforza map (which I now think is a photo reproduction of the original map) you can easily understand why authors would decide to simplify the number of zones Cavelli-Sforza's map is o.k. for the lighter half of the shades of skin color, but the darker shades are practically indistinguishable. Sometimes, if you know where to look, you will see what looks like a little halftoning rather than straight black ink. But for practical purposes the map is pretty useless outside of the values that are shown in the Americas. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENÂ§ In a way it was a good thing that the original map was so washed out. If I hadn't really looked carefully at it I'm pretty sure I'd have missed the white band. The uncorrected map has propagated so many places on the WWW that it's hard to believe the original maker of the digitized image has any objection to others using it. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Cleanup==NEWLINE_TOKENWe need to clean up the article. The sections should only treat what it says they do in the section title. For example, there shouldn't be a paragraph ``NEWLINE_TOKEN:``In everyday speech, race is often used to describe populations that are better defined as ethnic groups...``NEWLINE_TOKENat the end of ``History of the term``. Nor should the ``Anthropology and genetics`` section, being placed after the history section, i.e. we are through with the historical aspect now, begin with NEWLINE_TOKEN:``In the 19th century many natural scientists made three claims about race: ...``NEWLINE_TOKEN(i.e. this bit still belongs in the 'history' section).

Somebody should read the entire article and weed out repetitions, too. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Von Luschan scale ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENÂ§ The von Luschan scale was a manufactured set of standard tiles that were colored so that a researcher could in relatively rapid order sort through his/her tiles and find the one that came closest to matching a given subject's skin color. Essentially the same method is still used today, at least in this increasingly anti-scientific nation, by dentists who want to match ceramic material used for making fillings with the color of their patient's tooth. They have a little cabinet full of ceramic ``teeth`` on little spindles. Each specimen has a different combination of hue and brightness from the others. Although one could easily create an electronic device to measure these factors to tighter tolerances, the low-tech device seems to meet professional standards. Similarly, given the fact that a subject's skin color could vary considerably due to contingent factors such as season and weather patterns, the von Luchan tiles probably provide all the accuracy that is useful. `"

The quote that Jayjg took out of context was a citation from the Qur'an that Hamas uses (also out of context) to justify the killing of Jews. Zionists use similar tactics (that's where Hamas learned it) by quoting the Torah and Talmud to justify the killing of non-Jews. ``We must treat the Arabs like the Amalekites`` is a common sentiment among extremist Zionists. There are quotes from Zionist rabbis on this page that are indistinguishable from the logic of Hamas clerics. The denial of Zionism's genocidal intent and practice is similar to Nazis who denied the Holocaust and Final Solution even as they conducted it. Zionists claim to be ethical and humanitarian while routinely killing hundreds of children, imprisoning thousands of adults and oppressing millions of non-Jews in the name of their Jewish supremacist ideology and state. `"

You need to post the names of prominent Islamic scholars and universities such as Al Azhar (not isolated radicals) who issued the death sentence against these people. The fatwa against Rushdie was rejected by Al Azhar and all countries except Iran.

Just throwing the names of isolated cases where someone received death threats from isolated anonymous radical doesn't prove Islam sanctions death sentence to it's critics! After 9/11, many Muslims and mosques received threats and some Muslims/Sikhs were even killed. That doesn't mean the US sanctions death to all American Muslims. You are such a pathetic joke, dude! Posting isolated cases where people received death threats from anonymous radicals doesn't prove a thing. We don't even know for sure who killed Rashad. You added even his name. You need to post the names of Muslim scholars who issues death sentence against, say, Rashad, Vincent van Gogg, and Menji.

I refuted that by giving examples that contradict that. You then claimed that every critic received a death sentence. You were refuted again. You then posted a list of isolated critics such as Rushdie, Menji, Rashad Khalifa, Theo van Gogh, etc, who received death threats from anonymous radicals.

The Israeli government propaganda repeated at the websites you list claims that the Palestinians started the al-Aqsa intifada before Sharon even visited the al-Aqsa site. Even the ``Palestine Facts`` source you cite and the objective Mitchell report point to Sharon's visit as the trigger for the al-Aqsa intifada.

According to the U.S. Department of State, ``Palestinians held large demonstrations and threw stones at police in the vicinity of the Western Wall. Police used rubber-coated metal bullets and live ammunition to disperse the demonstrators, killing 4 persons and injuring about 200.``[4] According to the GOI, 14 Israeli policemen were injured.[5] Similar demonstrations took place over the following several days.[6] Thus began what has become known as the ``Al-Aqsa Intifada`` (Al-Aqsa being a mosque at the Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount). `` NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Furthermore, in the article Terrorism_against_Israel_in_2000#August, it says Biri died in August after being attacked by ``terrorists``.

aggression,"`NEWLINE_TOKENWhat I find, reading these paragraphs, is a decidedly pro-Zayed bias. To assume that anyone who criticizes him in that article must have never went near the Middle East, or the UAE, is preposterous. My own contributions, as well as others, are based on travel and life in the UAE, as well as trustworthy sources like the BBC and Reuters, among others. Also, that he funded all those wonderful projects around the world is not in dispute. To say that it was from his own pocket, however, is ludicrous. As with all the rich Gulf leaders, their personal wealth CAME from the nation's oil wealth. Their checkbooks and the State Treasury were often indistinguishable. Nevertheless, Zayed could have easily chosen to horde the UAE's wealth only for Emiratis, but he didn't, and that is evident. As far as the propaganda pictures and TV footage Falcon44 refers to, I have seen it with my own eyes. It does not negate what he did, but it's important to edify readers that Media in the UAE is strictly controlled, and cult-worship of the ruling families was institutionalized. Again, this does not mean that Zayed was not genuinely liked and admired, but it is important to state all the facts. The simple fact is that there was not one jot of criticism allowed on the airwaves or in print. This is no great slur on Zayed or the UAE. The only 3 relatively lively and free presses in the Arab world are Lebanon, Egypt, and pre-war Kuwait. Qatar is just now experimenting with free media. Regardless, what is more evidence of a pro-Zayed bias then the systematic removal of every scrap of criticism from the article? Why do certain individuals not want the world to know that one of his weddings is recorded in the Guinness Book of Records as the most expensive ever? Why are they afraid to let people know that Zayed's ``election`` to the Presidency was by a mere group of 6 sheiks and not by a free and popular vote? All these facts were shamelessly deleted several times from the article. THAT is what I call bias. Also, you quoted one of his advisors. It is not very shocking that such a person would be overflowing with praise about his employer and benefactor. I do not consider that an objective source. That doesn't mean it cannot be mentioned. As long as it is made clear who said it, the readers can draw their own conclusions about the possible bias of the quotation. Perhaps you should include that quotation in the article, Falcon. Also, regarding the Zayed Center, that was not my contribution, but I find it very interesting. What you mentioned about it in this talk section is very important. I look forward to you expanding on how he founded the center, and why he became disenchanted with it and withdrew his support.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOh, incidentally, it would be a great help if you, and all contributors, made use of the ``edit summary`` section so that the rest of us can more efficiently keep track of who added/deleted what and for what reason.

aggression,NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOK. I notice last night about 5 am or so Wyss said to me 'goodnight Ennis' which is just yet another personal attack - unpunished (of course). Anyway I followed your advice and have taken the 'challenge' to NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI am not asking you to comment - I know you have to/want to/feel the need to 'keep in' with other Wikis and I am just an anonymous Brit (or worse - Sollog Arrrgh!) I am just bringing the challenge to your attention as I suspect Wyss will avoid it and the post will be reverted - and his Â£2000 (or equivalent) will not go to help the bereaved. Remember - no comment required.
aggression,"NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI wonder why you think it's absurd to a) try and raise funds for those harmed by a natural disaster and b) to prove once and for all that these repetitive - almost chanting - claims I am Ennis are false. If the 'Number is Ennis' dichotomy was removed the Talk Pages would be near empty! I wonder why you condemn my attempts to bring honesty to these pages.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBut, that's rhetorical - as I said, there must be certain camaraderie among Wiki people and I doubt if youâ€™d want to jeopardise that even if your quest was integrity.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow you have asked me a sensible question, so I'll answer.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFor some time I watched these pages and saw that posts from people in the UK/claiming they were in the UK were summarily dismissed. Worse, posters were automatically accused of being Ennis.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOne reason given was that the posts were anonymous.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo I thought, as I know more about Ennis than others from the UK posting here (IMO) I'd try to add to these pages. However, even with an identity, I got exactly the same treatment. In fact Cardinal Chunder also got the same treatment even though he has an anti-Sollog website and is well known in Google groups for arguing with sollog(ites).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo it became clear that it would be impossible to add anything constructive unless either the accusations 'You're a sock puppet! Youâ€™re Ennis!' were either suppressed or disproved.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI therefore asked what the criteria would be to 'prove' I was not Ennis - and presumably this criteria would apply to others. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI tried to prove I was not in America (I thought these days all IPs were traceable but perhaps the 'proxy argument' holds sway - though quite how 'proxies work' is beyond me) I quoted extracts from a newspaper that was not on the net.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis was dismissed.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSomeone else even went to a pub in Lyndhurst and posted what was next to where he was sitting.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThat too was dismissed.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo it became obvious that no proof I (or anyone else) was not Ennis would ever be accepted.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTherefore the only other option if I felt I had something to contribute would be to suppress the hyena-like accusations (never backed up BTW)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn vain did I quote Wiki Official Policy. Plainly it is not obeyed by Editors/Administrators vis a vis the treatment of contributors.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo what is left? I cannot invoke Wiki policy. I cannot 'prove' I am here, in England sitting quietly in front of a PC.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTwo choices.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENStop posting completelyNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTry and 'challenge' the main accuser so once and for all this behaviour would stop. The only challenge worth it would be one where I did not personally gain (Of course I would win because I am not Ennis) and where proof involving a third party held in esteem (e.g. Ashley) acted as 'witness'.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHence the challenge.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI fear that will be deleted; I'll be castigated a usual and that's that. It really is just hopeless.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI have started deleting all my posts and if the challenge is reverted Iâ€™ll know there simply is no hope and I'll delete all my posts if I can find them.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou see, unless people accept I am not Ennis everything I or anyone else writes who is similarly accused will simply be dismissed. I'd prefer it if people read the post without looking at the poster - but they don't.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI have other interests - I posted on the Yoga page but it's quiet and I am interested in politics etc etc.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo we'll see what happens. Like I said, my view is that it's just hopeless trying to treat others as adults as all some want to do is - and they admit this - bait, bait and bait and if you do rise to it you're banned and if you don't it shows your inability. Truly a page that brings out the juvenile in what I assume are adults.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo there you are. I have answered your question fully and honestly and we'll just see what happens. It will answer the question - at least for these Sollog pages - as to whether Wiki should be taken seriously or not.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFinally if, as expected, the post is reverted it will provide a fitting end to the article I am writing (I am a freelance writer and no, Iâ€™m not going to prove it) before I send it off to newspapers.

aggression,"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Changes, subtle errors ==NEWLINE_TOKENOleg, I am concerned about the edits that you are making. My first impression is that it is much harder to understand than it used to be. It used to be precise as to what it meant; much of that precision has been removed. The result is the sublte introduction of errors... in part by removing that precision. For example, the ring over tau_p is not isomorphic to the ring x^n^p which is what you seem to be implying; the degrees of polynomials are totatlly different: if P(tau) is a polynomial, then n^(deg P(tau)) = deg P(x) one is kind-of-like the exp/ad of the other, sort-of. And you cut out the paragraphs that made this distinction: tau a is not equal to a tau, but tau a is equal to a^p tau ...NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe ring is never commutative when the field is not F_p ... NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe field is called F_p not Z/pZ dammit. We already talked about this before.

aggression,"NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Ross Perot and the Reform Party ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI edited to include Ross Perot because his candidacy everywhere was talked about as appealing to the 'radical middle' (in the press even). He said he was a social moderate and fiscal conservative, but his general tone was of centrismwhich is why for years after 'swing voters'/centrist voters/independents were called 'Perot voters'. On most issues he came to compromises between Democrats and Republicans with hard solutions. For instance he said both tax cuts and tax increases were needed. He also felt that partisanship and gridlock between the parties caused most problems, including incessant debates on social issues like abortion. But he promoted issues that appealed to the center (that weren't just plain 'centrist' but pro-active positions that at that time hadn't been talked about much before) like balanced budgets, campaign finance reform, referendums, term limits, etc.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Reform Party was based on this platform and was radically centristmembers even called themselves 'centrist'. People in the party felt there were definite issues that needed to be solved, and the two major parties had to be challenged to solve them, with the creation of a new party. Today, many might say the party has a chink in this line of thought, because after Pat Buchanan and his supporters entered the party in the 2000 election, hard stances on immigration started to enter party platforms.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhich is somewhat right-but even still it doesn't compromise on the idea. I read Noam Chomsky once wrote that in America the groups on the fringes of politicslike Nader on the left, Buchanan on the right, and Perot in the center, agreed substantially on their significant issuesand he proposed that they joined together in a pretzel to form the 'radical middle'. A radical 'centrist' is an uneasy concept, since politics always changes and what will be moderate will change. The idea here though is that there is a growing set of issues that is not shared by left or right parties (fair trade, campaign finance reform, balanced budgets). That those who support these issues also carry different baggage of their own, tied to left-right positions, like Buchanan with abortion or immigration, should be expected.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf you're talking about John McCain, he plays to many of these positions (but is still free trade). But he's usually still what you might call a 'sensible' centrist and usually falls on the right, where he is. I was in the Reform Party (i think my analysis is accurate so don't bring up the bias), and many members hated McCain because he was a 'false reformer'-for instance his McCain-Feingold act made it even harder for third parties, while not doing anything substantial for reform. The sentiment was that he was just taking advantage of the issues for his public image. If you even listen to his speeches on reform he gives no substance just uses the phrase 'special interests' liberally.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFrom what I know about UK politics, Tony Blair looks more like Clintonesque centrism (which is purely political) than anything else.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN"

aggression,"NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAndy, thank you very much! ) What are the locations of those lost buildings? All in Aachen? I was wondering if the Holy Roman Empire was supposed to be inclusive for the whole of Western Europe, such as unofficially having traditionally independent places as England and other Catholic lands as subdivisions during that time. The reason being, that there was only one emperor during those times(in the West) and only after Protestantism did multiple emperors become a feature of Western Europe. Was the King of England a Sovereign during the time predating the Anglican schism, or was he subordinate to the Holy Roman Emperor? I postulate this, due to the fact that the Cardinals and Archbishops were subordinate to the Pope and figured that there's some part of history not being told to enough children. Wouldn't that be a reason to break with the Vatican back then? Once Henry broke with the Church, he was able to incorporate Wales and the Royal House changed from province to surname. I was thinking that the provincial royal house like Anjou, Blois or Normandy is a Continental style. Once England broke away, they went to personal names like Tudor and Stuart...even though Henry was technically of the House of Richmond. Once England had become the center of another empire, just of its own, they reverted to usage of provincial houses. So, what do you think...Am I right?"

aggression,"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Ward Churchill is Not An Indian ==NEWLINE_TOKENI am an enrolled member of Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma and I used to work for the BIA. I added into the article the written opinions of people that have researched Churchill's Indian ancestry and 99% of these Indian folks point out that Churchill has not provided the basic information required to prove that he is an Indian. I put it up last night and it much of it was taken down early this morning. It was information where I provided sources for the comments. I understand that what I wrote can and should be edited. But taking out information that provides sources and citations seems to be an attempt to stifle the information. Dear Fred Bauder, it IS fair to ask if Churchill really is an Indian. He is taking away from actual Indian people the ability to speak for themselves. He has build his whole career on being someone who has experienced the oppression of a minority culture. It is similar to a white middle class Protestant person from Idaho was writing books about himself being a Jew in Hitler's Germany. And don't even say that I just made a inaccurate analogy because Churchill himself compares and uses Hitler and Nazi analogies. I'm sure that is how you learned about him in the first place because he made this most recent comment about 9/11 victims are all ``Eichmann's.`` Look, providing information about whether you are an Indian or not should not be that difficult. Why? You have Indian parents. It is simple as that. Even if you don't have brothers and sisters then you have Indian parents and your parents have brothers and sisters. Correct? Why doesn't anyone in Indian Country know any of these people? This is NOT a cheap shot as you indicated above. It goes to the heart of who he claims that he is. As Suzan Harjo pointed out: Churchill is taking jobs and speaking engagements from real actual Indians and building a whole career on it. Those jobs and speaking engagements should go to actual Indian. Also, Harjo made the point that Churchill's comments are having a backlash and where is that backlash going? On to Indian Country. Look, no one believes that he should not have the right to say what he wants. We all believe in the First Amendment even if it is difficult speech. However, just don't run around and claim that you are an Indian when you aren't and that you personally have been oppressed. Let's say that I am a white person that lives in Kentucky and I attend a Baptist church and my parents came the United States from South Africa, do you really believe that I could run around and write books on Irish experience of oppression in Belfast? No. But that is what he is doing. And you are calling it a cheap shot. It is not a cheap shot. It goes to who and what he is. He is what we call in Indian Country a Wannabee. There is a whole tribe of Indians called the Wannabee Indians and he is the Chief. The people that making the complaints about his fake Indian heritage are not conservatives by any stretch of the imagination either: Suzan Harjo (worked for Bill Clinton), Dennis Banks (Founder of the American Indian Movement), etc. He can say wherever he wants about 9/11 or America, but he shouldn't lie and claim that he is an Indian when he isn't. And schools like the Univ of Colorado should do a better job of doing there homework when they hire a someone and put out to the world that he is an Indian because he isn't.Keetoowah `"

aggression,"NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Some personal observations here: ==NEWLINE_TOKENPut a summary of it into the Roots of Christianity; perhaps a whole subsection thereof. If the Zoroastrianism part is included, then so must the Egyptian especially since the Hebrews were long associated with Egypt back to the Hyksos invasion. It would be POV to disclude this factor, considering the trail of monotheism left by Akhenaten and adopted by the Hebrews. I myself don't know much about Zoroaster, but I certainly recognise much of the Egyptian issue and I'm more of a casual researcher. It seems to me that Zoroastrian elements are tied to the Persian background, but it would be prejudiced to say that the Egyptians have no basis when they long dominated Palestine. The Greek Pharaoh himself patroned the Septuagint in Alexandria. I find the bigotry towards an Egyptian root of Christianity to be entirely unfounded when so much of Egyptian culture was adopted by all peoples in a certain radius outwards. Perhaps this lies in traditional ideas about race; that the Hamites of Africa have not contributed anything and that the Persians supposedly were/are White or considered Japhethic as opposed to the Semites. Seriously, this Noahidic classification thing is ridiculous because these Afro-Asiatic people are undoubtedly very much alike and most uninvolved observers would say they are less White than the Greeks and Romans. I consider Persians to be Semites because they are Asian, in this context. Give it as much credence as the Persian foundations and you will make this NPOV. I seriously suggest expounding upon both roots of Christianity and also delineating the Greek root which provided Roman impetus for adoption and proliferation. For instance, if the Greeks hadn't patroned that religious culture as their relation to Philistines, Rome would have dismissed it as everything else in their cultural relationship with Greece. Rome even rebuilt Greek Philistia as Palestine and during the Catholic Crusades, it became the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Christianity has so many dimensions, that it would be haughty to overlook its far ranging origins which even has pagan influences from Europe and Buddhist ties in Southwest Asia. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI myself used to be atheist or Odinist not wanting to deal with what I percieved to be other peoples' culture and now I look in wonder at the historical background of the Sea Peoples and the subsequent Graeco-Roman expansion in the Mediterranean Sea. There are European roots throughout the region now considered Islamic or Arab, but if we don't provide the means for people to see it we will forget it as much as the terrible destruction of the Library of Alexandria. Just think of the term Indo-European and you will understand Alexander the Great's empire. See the connection between the European fylfot and Indian swastika or the Cross and the Ankh? Please don't demolish this magnificent research, for it has been a great boon in my life to know these things. I am only stating things as I commonly have studied and heard of them. I do not propose to limit and debar other positions on this issue, therefore I am not endorsing POV. The various sources I have seen via Google search appear legitimate and/or sometimes biased(as anything!), but it is not my position to judge the appropriateness of the topic. We are not to cast a POV on the issue in favour or against, just to deliver as any messenger does. The existing article on the History of Christianity provides the Persian background but does not give adequate coverage of the Egyptian or Hellenic origins, which are quite prominent. After all, Christianity had most of its evolution in non-Persian areas of the Mediterranean Sea. Tell me, how many Persian people are prominent in the Christian world throughout its history? What fractionary comparison can you draw that factually examines the amount and shows a majority of Persian elements in Christianity, compared to the vast amount of Greek specialty(as written, verified and generally known amongst the entire Christian populace) and the nursery of Christianity itself in Egypt via the Old Testament(even Jesus's infancy was spent in Egypt, in safety from Herod!)? Please, where is the background of Christianity in Persia besides 19th century racial studies? Like I've said, the Noahide classification thing has been similarly discredited and its density in weight grew most during that era for Indo-Aryan racist theories."

aggression,"Ignoring the question of how long it will take to actually use it all up, I am prepared to concede the point that if the modern increase rate in CO2 can be extrapolated to burning all known reserves then that would put us at about 700 ppm or less (2.5 times preindustrial levels). Now, there is a big if in there since we don't really know how existing carbon sinks like soils, forests, and the oceans will respond to increasing CO2. Right now, these systems buffer the atmosphere so that the annual increase at Mauna Lao is actually significantly lower (by about 50%) than if you just calculate the increase expected from all the CO2 humans dump into the atmosphere. Basically because CO2 has increased, these systems draw down more CO2 than they did in preindustrial times and hence partially offset our pollution. Some scientists think this buffer will become ever more effective as CO2 rises, others think it will saturate and a substantially lower fraction of our waste will be absorbed. Obviously, such uncertainties are important for figuring out max CO2.NEWLINE_TOKEN:::Taking for the moment a value of 700 ppm as a reasonable end point, that still seems potentially bad. How bad probably depends on how sensitive things like thermohaline circulation are to multiple degree changes in temperature, and how big a feedback is associated with retreating sea ice and permafrost. Not exactly a risk I am eager to take given existing climate uncertainties. However, at face value it would seem to take some disasterous scenarios off the table. For example, it is estimated that the wholesale deglaciation of Antarctica won't occur till 3-3.5 times preindustrial CO2 levels. (This was presented at a conference of the American Geophysical Union, but I am having trouble finding a reference).NEWLINE_TOKEN:::I think your consideration of how high can CO2 levels really get is a valid one, and potentially very intersting. However, given the uncertainties involved in such estimates, I would really like to see if we can find something published on the issue. An academic paper would (hopefully) have spent more time thinking through these issues and work out what kind of a range of values is possible.NEWLINE_TOKEN::: NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN"

Anyhow, I did provide evidence, but I guess your idea of evidence is a photograph or a video tape showing Shahrbanoo being dragged on sand by the Arabs. So Ali knew Persian, eh? I suppose you have evidence for this? The page you asked me to click says Ali knew persian and furthermore it quotes a Shia hadith which claims the following masterpiece of comedy:NEWLINE_TOKEN:Ali, then came up to the princess and asked: ``What is your name?`` The princess replied: ``The daughter of Jahan-shah``. Ali said: ``and so Shahr-banuyeh you will be called`` (``the bride of the land``).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDo you honestly believe that?! That claim is embarrassingly stupid. So what evidence you have that Ali knew Persian? And what evidence you have that Shahrbanoo, who was clearly captured by the Arabs, married Hussayn willingly? Oh, and for your good information, there is plenty of solid historical evidence that her name was Shahrbanoo, and the Arabs didn't gave her that name. Even if and Arab knew some Persian, what are the chances they knew the difference between the double meaning of ``land/country and city`` for ``shahr``? At any rate, the Zoroastrians also call her Shahrbanoo, and if her name was given by Ali to her, the Zoros would have referred to her by her original name not by her allegedly Arab given name. Besides, didn't it occur to your brilliant mind that if Ali was going to give her a name, he would have given her an Islamic name not a Persian name? `"

aggression,"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf you really beleive all that Shia crap, then good luck to you, cuz you're gonna need it in life. You don't seem to have a solid grip on reality. You seem to live in your own world. Anyhow, I will give you a bit of clue free of charge. The reason there are some favourable Hadiths for Iranians is, surprise surprise, because out of the 6 main Hadith authors, 4 were Iranians, including the 3 most authoritative ones: Bukhari, Termezi and Hajjaj. Nasai was also Iranian. The first 3 were Khurasani, and Nasai was from Pars. The other 2 Hadith authors are not as major and their works are basically a copy-and-paste from the Hadith of the Iranian authors. Hajjaj was from Neyshapour but claimed to be of Qushayri origin, so that he was better accepted as some ``real Arab`` from an authentic Arabic origin, but there is academic information that he was indeed of Khorasani origin, and his claim of ``al-Qushayri`` roots is unverifiable. The most authoritative of the Hadiths is al-Bukhari (from the city of Bukhara). Having read what you wrote for me, I have reason to believe that someone like you is out of touch with reality and I am not even going to accept an edit war with someone like you. So I let you be happy by deleting the ``forced`` out of the article, and stay happy with your romanticism and keep thinking that Shahrbanoo indeed chose Husayn and they ``lived happily ever after!``, and both Ali and Muhammad knew Persian, and ``Shahrbanoo realized that they had special knowledge``!! hehe no wonder your nation is the way it is today, their ``educated`` people are like you, I can imagine what the uneducated ones are like!! -) `"

Obviously he has never read my work. Most likely he is unfamiliar with the extremely readable and scholarly books of James Webb on occultism, including Nazi permutations of same. Nazism was clearly based on occultism evident in every respect from the Thule Society and Theosophical Society roots to the swastika itself. Hitler did not take his notions from a vaccuum his notions of ``cleansing actions``, ``master races`` and ``aryanism`` were standard fare in all occult reading both of Rosicrucians and Theosophists. As far as left hand swastikas and right hand swastikas are concerned, there are ample books (many of which are in my personal library) showing that it was used interchangeably both ways in both occult and Indian cultures. The Jews were singled out for hatred in most such literature and still are in the books published by Lucis Trust / Lucis Publishing Company. Just look at the indexes (and you can do free internet searches): ``Judaism: evils of``; ``Judaism, need for dissolution of``. I have BATTLED Nazism and racism all of my life, starting at age 4 when I told an aunt, ``that man's not bad because he wants to move in your neighborhood. You're bad because you want to move out just because he's moving in . . .`` Squeakbox owes me an apology. He confesses he flunked logic. He also confesses to a closed head injury with a machete type instrument. For that, I will give him in good Christian style, a charitable interpretation and hope to think that these are his honest interpretations. Read the New Age books CAREFULLY and not in an altered state you will find that they are not all peace, light love. And people who come against them are not ``Nazis`` the kernel of Nazism is the occultism which in its essence spells doom to all who are not blonde, blue-eyed pagans in its ultimate world view. I have many a New Age book from the early 1980s in my vast personal collection which tells Orientals, Africans, etc., that they should be practicing celibacy as their races are destined to die out anyway.
